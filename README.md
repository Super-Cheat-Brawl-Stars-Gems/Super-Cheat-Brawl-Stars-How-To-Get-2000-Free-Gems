Uses of Gems in Brawl Stars
Brawl Pass:

Gems are most commonly used to purchase the Brawl Pass, a seasonal progression system with exclusive rewards like skins, boxes, and other cosmetics.
Skins:

Players can use gems to buy character skins, which change the appearance of Brawlers and sometimes include unique animations or sound effects.
Pin Packs:

Players can buy Pin Packs using gems to unlock emotive pins for Brawlers.
Token Doublers:

You can spend gems to purchase Token Doublers, which increase the rate at which you earn progression tokens.
Coins:

Gems can also be exchanged for coins, which are used to upgrade Brawlers.
Mega Boxes and Offers:

Gems can purchase Mega Boxes, which contain rewards like Power Points, Coins, and possibly new Brawlers. They can also be used to buy limited-time shop offers.
How to Get Gems
Purchases with Real Money:

Gems are mainly purchased through the in-game shop with real money. Prices vary depending on your region and platform.
Brawl Pass Free Track:

Players can earn a small number of gems by progressing through the free track of the Brawl Pass. Collecting gems here consistently over seasons can eventually accumulate enough for the premium Brawl Pass.
Special Offers:

Occasionally, Supercell releases discounted gem bundles or offers that include gems and other bonuses.
Spending Tips
Save for the Brawl Pass: The Brawl Pass provides the best value for your gems, as it includes both the premium track rewards and a chance to earn more gems than you spent.
Prioritize Cosmetics and Value Packs: Use gems on cosmetic skins or bundles only after securing the Brawl Pass if you're a free-to-play player.
Avoid Impulse Purchases: Spend gems on offers or items with clear long-term benefits rather than random purchases like Mega Boxes.
